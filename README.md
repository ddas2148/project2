# Summary
The main motive of the research is to develop a regression model based on the kc_house.csv. Here we did linear regression, histogram, and plotting some diagrams with the help of the dataset.

# What is the aim of this project?

Linear regression is mainly used for analyzing and predicting the value of the variable which is based on the overall value of another variable. All of the variables that have been predicted are called dependent variables. I want to build a model where i can predict house price based on different other factors like - number of bedrooms, bathroom and others different variable in the dataset. This Model will help my client ( ideally realestate agent) to predict a house price based on other variables and sale in the market!

 # What should this project accomplish for the business?

From this model and linear regression, it is very easy to understand that how house price depends on various types of attributes! My client realestate business can determine/predict a price guide for their vendor! Also can help property estimator for their property value estimation purpose!

# Content:

**Folder** = data folder content the data set I have used for building this model

**Project2.ipynb** is the working in jupyter notebook

**Non-technical presentation** file is for a short presentation about the model (can be found= http://localhost:8890/view/nontechnical%20presentation.slides.html )

## Brief findings: 
From the given dataset we can see that there are multiple variables that can influence the price! There are 18 different variables that can influence the price with many other different variables which we don’t have the data or questions about yet! From the correlation heatmap we can see which variables have more influences on the price! Below I have given a list of the variables that have more influences on the price- -bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, sqft_living, sqft_lot', grade, condition, floors…. We want to build a few models which can tell us which are the variable influences most to predict price! The end user will be buyers/ property value estimators but our real estate company (our client here can guide them! Some of the data from buyers might have helped to improve this model! a few of the questions could be= what is the family size? What is the purpose of buying the property investment or living in? income of the household? Those answers could help to determine more affordability and that might help me to get the model improved a lot!

# Conclusion: 
In conclusion, adding more variables shows our model improves! However, it is very hard to determine a very perfect price as price depends on other variables like economy, countries current GDP and cash rate etc! Currently happening in Australia for example! House prices are going down due to the bank interest rate increasing!
