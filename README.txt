Summary
The main motive of the research is to develop a regression model based on the kc_house.csv. Here we did linear regression, histogram, and plotting some diagram with the help of the dataset.

What is your role in this project?
Linear regression is mainly used for analyzing and predict the value of the variable which is based on the overall value of another variable. All of the variable that have been predicted is called dependent variable.

Why linear regression is used?
Linear regression is used to predict modeling and analysis. The variable is used for predicting other variables value which is called independent variable.

Where linear is being used?
Such as it used for medical researchers which often use linear regression for understanding the relationship between drug and blood pressure of patients, estimate price of a house, real estate investor, or an estimator. 

What should this project accomplish for the business?
From this product and linear regression, it is very easy to understand the house price with different needs of the real estate investor. In this project the customer is real estate investor and user is estimator.

Content:
Folder= data folder content the data set I have used for building this model
Project2.ipynb is the working in jupyter notebook
Non-technical presentation file is for a short presentation about the model

Theory: in our model 3 and 2a r-squared number slightly increased but they number i was looking around 70% above but some reason this model unable to reach that far! Even though we can see that price can increase based on those used variables, but we can only predict 53.3% correctly and rest of the 46.7% reason we don’t know! Which means we might need more relevant data!

Brief findings: From the given dataset we can see that there are multiple variables can influence the price! There are 18 different variables can influence the price with other different many variables which we don’t have the data or questions yet! From the correlation heatmap we can see which the variables have more influences on the price! Below I have given a list of the variables have more influences on the price- -bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, sqft_living, sqft_lot', grade, condition, floors…. We want built few models which can tell us which are the variable influences most to predict price! The end user will buyers/ property value estimators but our real estate company (our client here can guide them! Some of the data from buyers might have helped to improve this model! few of the questions could be= what is the family size? What is the purpose of buying the property investment or live in? income of household? Those are answers could help to determine more affordability and that might help me to get the model improved a lot!

Conclusion: In the conclusion by adding more variables shows our model improves! however it is very hard to determine very perfect price as price depends on other variables like economy, countries current GDP and cash rate etc! Currently happening in Australia for example! House price is going down due to bank interest rate is increasing!
